   <p>I designed and conducted this survey to look for improvements on a well-received production infotainment system.  This survey involved users going through a list of tasks while the vehicle was stopped and in motion, followed by providing written feedback.  Each user was also filmed for review.</p>

   <p>An additional takeaway from this survey was how the industry looks at vehicle usability.  Many in the industry talk of the ‘rental car’ usability standard, where a user should be able to use a new vehicle without much learning curve.  This survey showed the implication that new technology has on that standard.</p>
